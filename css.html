      <h1 class="underline">CSS basics</h1>
      <p>CSS (<span class="bold underline"> C</span>ascading <span class="bold underline"> S</span>tyle <Span  class="bold underline" >S</Span>heets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?

      </p>
      <h2 id="css_anatomy_heading">What is CSS?</h2>
      <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. <span class="bold">CSS is a style sheet language</span>. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. <span> For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:</span> 

      </p>
      <h2 class="underline">Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
      <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works :</p>

      <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset.</p>
      <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:
          <ul><li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
            <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
            <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>

          </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Different types of selectors</h3>
      <p><ol>
          <li>Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector)-All HTML elements of the specified type.</li>
          <li>ID selector-The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique.</li>
        <li>Class selector-The element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page.</li>
        <li>Attribute selector-The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute.</li>
        <li>Pseudo-class selector-The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.)</li>
      </ol></p>
      <p>There are many more selectors to discover. To learn more, see the MDN
